Being a good team member means being proactive and keeping communication flowing. Making sure that the team is working together to complete each sprint successfully and learning from our mistakes together. It's not about pointing fingers or taking all the credit, it's about helping the customer reach their goals as a team and making sure everyone takes part in it.
